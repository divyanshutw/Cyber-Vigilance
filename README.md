# **Cyber-Vigilance**

### **Problems** 

* 1. We all know that the cyber crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. As the technology is growing daily tasks are becoming easier for the people and with that are coming the loopholes in the system. Fraudsters take advantage of these loopholes in the system only.
* 2. People are not well aware of the what to do and what not to do because the technology is new but the people are old. People of more than 40 years of age haven't seen such technology in their times and so they are most vulnerable to frauds. Once caught, people don't know what to do next.

## **How will cyber vigilance app help in solving these problems?**

Loopholes will exist in any kind of system. We can minimize them but their will be loopholes in every system. For example, the concept of One Time Password was brought to tackle cyber frauds but still people found loopholes in it too. 
Not only this, there are other things like cyber bullying, how will we tackle this?
Our approach in solving the given problem statement is based on an old idea: **Prevention is better than cure.**

* We will post news regarding the latest cyber crimes so that people be well informed about them and can avoid them.
* We have tried to educate people about the cyber crimes, what should they do to be safe and what to do if caught in the trap.
* The e-sim fraud is caused when someone enters your gmail account, most of the cyber bullying activities are carried out when someone is able to get into your social media accounts. So passwords must be strong, different and should be changed peoidically but with all this, the management of these passwords becomes an issue. The app has a password manager with it.
